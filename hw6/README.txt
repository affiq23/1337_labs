1. capitalized all of the information from the csv file, was easier to read when printed out
2. header files were giving errors for some reason, so I added file guards to make sure each header is only used once
3. couldn't get counting variables to work, was giving errors; just ended up using number of items in each vector to count how many different animals
4. everything else should be pretty straightforward
